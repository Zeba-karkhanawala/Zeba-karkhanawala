### Hello ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
With a background in Electrical Engineering, I love making connections between data and business to drive intelligent decision-making. My passion lies in AI and ML, where I specialize in building advanced RAG models, LLMs, and AI Agents to create impactful solutions.

Currently, I am an AI Agents Developer Intern at Virgent AI, exploring the next frontier of AI by transitioning from RAGs to autonomous AI agents. Previously, as an AI Engineer Intern at Intripid, I worked on RAGs and LLMs using tools like LangChain and DSPy, where I helped architect "What's Next?" - an intelligent recommender system now used by over 2,000 satisfied users.

I'm a proud member of the Asian Women Advancing AI (AWAAI) community, where I had the opportunity to lead a RAG Seminar & Hands-on Workshop in February 2025. I also had the honor of being featured on a Snowpal podcast titled "What it takes to get into one of the best colleges in India?" alongside IITian Zeba Karkhanawala, where I shared my journey and insights for aspiring students.

My curiosity drives me to continuously learn about AI research, AI ethics, and the future of AI. 

When Iâ€™m not building AI solutions, youâ€™ll find me reading abou dragons and magicðŸª„ 

ðŸ’¡ Always open to connecting with fellow AI enthusiasts! If you have an interesting AI book recommendation or just want to geek out over LLMs, drop me a message - letâ€™s talk about whatâ€™s next in AI! ðŸš€
